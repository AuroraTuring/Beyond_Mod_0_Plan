# Beyond Mod 0 Plan 
## Aurora Sanderson 

I will be checking out and working through the mod 1 prework suggested to us. I'm setting aside two hours a day, including weekends, to learning and working through the challenges. I will also be squeezing as many doctor's appointments as I can in the break we have until November 27th, when class starts. My desk needs a little bit of organizing, but other than that my workspace is pretty well set up. I'll be figuring out a meal plan and food I can buy that's easy to prep and consume. I also plan to hang out with friends virtually and in person before I get too busy in full time class to spend time with others.
